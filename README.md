Animon is an open-source CSS library that lets you animate your website without having to make your own animations.
## Installation

#### Importing

Animon can be imported into your project by placing the code below at the top of your CSS file.

```css
@import "https://sericted.github.io/animon/keyframes.css";
```

#### Linking (recommended)

Animon can be linked with your stylesheet by pasting the code below at the bottom of your HTML ```<head>``` tag.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sericted.github.io/animon/keyframes.css">
```
## Usage/Examples

Now that Animon has been set up, all that is left to do is use the pre-built keyframes that Animon has built for you.
Before you do that, make sure you know how to use the CSS ```animation:``` property.
```css
animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state
```
## Available Keyframes

Here are all the current keyframes Animon offers you.

```css
animon__fadeIn      /* Fades in */

animon__fadeOut     /* Fades out */

animon__blink       /* Blinks */
```
